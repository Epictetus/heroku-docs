Custom Error Pages
===================

Heroku's HTTP router serves unstyled HTML when your app encounters a system-level error, or while maintenance mode is enabled for your app. The Custom Error Pages add-on lets you provide URLs to error and maintenance pages of your own.

Upload your custom pages
------------------------

Create your custom pages as static HTML.  You may wish to use the default HTML served by Heroku as a template:

* [http://s3.amazonaws.com/heroku_pages/error.html](http://s3.amazonaws.com/heroku_pages/error.html)
* [http://s3.amazonaws.com/heroku_pages/maintenance.html](http://s3.amazonaws.com/heroku_pages/maintenance.html)

You can reference images or CSS from the HTML as long as you use relative paths (e.g., `<img src="error.png">`) and you upload the other assets into the same place as the HTML.

You can host the pages anywhere that can serve web pages; we recommend uploading to Amazon S3.  If you use S3, don't forget to set the HTML and all assets to be publicly readable.

Heroku setup
------------

Install the add-on:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add custom_error_pages
    Adding custom_error_pages to myapp...done.

Now you can set ERROR_PAGE_URL and MAINTENANCE_PAGE_URL to point at your custom pages:

    :::term
    $ heroku config:add ERROR_PAGE_URL=http://s3.amazonaws.com/your_bucket/your_error_page.html MAINTENANCE_PAGE_URL=http://s3.amazonaws.com/your_bucket/your_maintenance_page.html

Testing your pages
------------------

To test your maintenance page:

    :::term
    $ heroku maintenance:on
    $ heroku open

Your logs will show an H80 code for that web hit, indicating that a maintenance page was served to the user:

    :::term
    $ heroku logs -p router -n 1
    2010-10-08T17:44:18-07:00 heroku[router]: H80 (Maintenance mode) -> GET myapp.herou.com/dyno=none queue=0 wait=0ms service=0ms bytes=0

To testing your error page, you can push a bad deploy such as putting a syntax error into `config.ru`, or by creating a path on your app that sleeps for 35 seconds (thereby triggering the error H12 Request Timeout).  For example, in a Sinatra app:

    :::ruby
    get '/errortest' do
      puts "Sleeping 35 seconds before I serve this page"
      sleep 35
      puts "Done sleeping"
      "ok"
    end

Now visit /errortest on your app, while watching your logs:

    :::term
    $ heroku logs --tail
    2010-10-08T18:04:40-07:00 app[web.1]: Sleeping 35 seconds before I serve this page
    2010-10-08T18:05:10-07:00 heroku[router]: Error H12 (Request timeout) -> GET myapp.heroku.com/errortest dyno=web.1 queue=0 wait=0ms service=0ms bytes=0
    2010-10-08T18:05:10-07:00 heroku[nginx]: GET /errortest HTTP/1.1 | 208.66.27.62 | 3364 | http | 503
    2010-10-08T18:05:15-07:00 app[web.1]: Done sleeping
