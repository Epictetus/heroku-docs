Maintenance Mode
================

If you're deploying a large migration or need to disable access to your application for some length of time, you can use Heroku's built in maintenance mode. It will serve a static page to all visitors, while still allowing you to run rake tasks or console commands.

Usage
-----

Enable it like so:

    :::term
    $ heroku maintenance:on
    Maintenance mode enabled.

Once your application is ready, you can disable maintenance mode with:

    :::term
    $ heroku maintenance:off
    Maintenance mode disabled.

Customization
-------------

You can also create your own content to display when your application goes into maintenance mode using the [Custom Error Pages add-on](http://addons.heroku.com/custom_error_pages).

To use, install the add-on and set your `MAINTENANCE_PAGE_URL`:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add custom_error_pages
    Adding custom_error_pages to myapp...done.

    $ heroku config:add MAINTENANCE_PAGE_URL=http://s3.amazonaws.com/your_bucket/your_maintenance_page.html

See the [Custom Error Pages docs](/custom-error-pages) for full details.
