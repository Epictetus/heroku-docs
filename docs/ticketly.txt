Ticketly
========

Ticketly is a simple bug and issue tracker that is fully integrated into Heroku. Collaborators on your project automatically get access to your tickets and your tickets are available from your Heroku dashboard. In addition you may optionally install a plugin that allows command line access to your tickets (coming soon).

Installation
------------

To use Ticketly on Heroku, install the Ticketly add-on:

  $ heroku addons:add ticketly:test
  Create your Ticketly project

From your app dashboard on the Heroku website, click on Add-ons â†’ Ticketly and you will be taken to your Ticketly project.

The first time each user accesses your project, they will have to create an account with Ticketly. The test plan allows up to 20 users at a time.
