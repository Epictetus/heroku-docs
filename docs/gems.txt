Managing Gems
=============

Ruby gems can be installed on Heroku via [Gem Bundler](http://github.com/wycats/bundler).  In addition for compatibility with legacy applications Heroku also still supports the .gems manifest.  It is important that you use only one in your application in order to avoid confusion.  

Gem Bundler
-----------

Gem Bundler is the best way to manage your gems.  We suggest all apps on Heroku use Bundler.  See our [bundler](/bundler) page for full details on Bundler support.

Gem Manifest
------------

The old .gems manifest is deprecated.  See the [gem manifest](/gemmanifest) page for full details on .gems support.
