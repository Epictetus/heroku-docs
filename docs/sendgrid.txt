Sendgrid SMTP add-on
===========

[Sendgrid](http://www.sendgrid.com/) offers a modern, API driven approach to SMTP delivery. Currently there are two offers available for Heroku users: Sendgrid basic, a free alternative for apps sending up to 200 messages a day - and premium, for apps with a high volume of emails.

Sendgrid Free
--------------

To enable free Sendgrid add-on, simply run:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid:free
    Adding sendgrid:free to myapp...done.

The basic account allows you to send up to 200 emails per day.

NOTE: Adding this add-on will instantly setup your Rails app to send emails using ActionMailer. Check the usage instructions below if you're not using Rails, or if you're using another framework to send emails.


Sendgrid Pro/Premium
--------------------

Increasing your outgoing email capability is equally simple. To activate one of the paid Sendgrid add-ons:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid:premium
    Adding sendgrid:premium to myapp...done.

Pro will bump your limit to 20,000 emails per month. Premium will give you 100,000.

Usage
-----

Rails apps using ActionMailer will just work, no setup is needed after the addon is installed.

If you're not using Rails and ActionMailer, you will need to setup your email framework manually; check out examples below.

NOTE: SendGrid requires you to setup the From: address when sending emails. Without it, their SMTP servers will silently drop emails.

### ActionMailer

In case you're not using it with Rails, it must be configured like:

    :::ruby
    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :address        => "smtp.sendgrid.net",
      :port           => "25",
      :authentication => :plain,
      :user_name      => ENV['SENDGRID_USERNAME'],
      :password       => ENV['SENDGRID_PASSWORD'],
      :domain         => ENV['SENDGRID_DOMAIN']
    }

### Other frameworks

Any email framework supporting SMTP and plain authentication can be used with Sendgrid.

In fact we encourage developers to take a look at [Pony](http://github.com/benprew/pony) for something simpler than ActionMailer, yet more convenient than net/smtp.

Either way, configure your email framework to use the server smtp.sendgrid.net, port 25. The SMTP username, password and domain are stored in the ENV vars, as you can see in the ActionMailer example above.
